# üìñ Classical Schema Theorem (Goldberg, 1989)

In words:

> Short, low-order, above-average schemata increase exponentially in expectation under selection, crossover, and mutation.

Formally (simplified):

$$
E[m(H, t+1)] \;\ge\; m(H, t)\cdot \frac{f(H)}{\bar f}\cdot (1 - p_c \tfrac{\delta(H)}{L-1})(1 - p_m)^{o(H)}
$$

Where:

* $m(H,t)$ = number of individuals in population matching schema $H$.
* $f(H)$ = average fitness of schema $H$.
* $\bar f$ = average population fitness.
* $p_c, p_m$ = crossover & mutation probabilities.
* $\delta(H)$ = defining length, $o(H)$ = order.

# üîÑ AEO Schema Theorem (Signal Form)

We replace **schemata** with **signal alignments** (phase, trend, energy), and **selection/crossover/mutation** with AEO laws.

---

### 1. State

* **Signal schema**: a region in $(\rho, V, \gamma, T)$-space where the AE machine stabilizes.
  Call it $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^4$.
* **Mass**: $m(S,t)$ = expected number of trajectories currently inside $S$.

---

### 2. Dynamics

* **Selection analogue**:
  Reward-adjusted gain ratio:

  $$
  G(S) = \frac{R(S)}{\bar R}
  $$

  where $R(S)$ = average reward in schema region $S$.

* **Crossover analogue (resonance/recurrence)**:
  Probability of disruption:

  $$
  P_\text{res}(S) \;\approx\; k_\rho \cdot \Delta \rho(S)
  $$

  where $\Delta\rho$ is deviation of alignment from resonance band.

* **Mutation analogue (noise law)**:
  Probability of disruption:

  $$
  P_\text{noise}(S) \;\approx\; k_V \cdot \frac{V(S)}{V^\star}
  $$

---

### 3. Theorem (AEO form)

$$
E[m(S, t+1)] \;\ge\; m(S, t)\cdot G(S)\cdot \big(1 - P_\text{res}(S)\big)\cdot \big(1 - P_\text{noise}(S)\big)
$$

---

### 4. Interpretation

* **\$m(S,t)\$**: instead of ‚Äústrings containing schema H,‚Äù we track the **fraction of trajectories in a stable signal pattern**.
* **\$G(S)\$**: selection pressure becomes **reward gain relative to average reward**.
* **\$P\_\text{res}(S)\$**: resonance law acts like crossover ‚Äî it can disrupt or reinforce phase alignments.
* **\$P\_\text{noise}(S)\$**: noise law acts like mutation ‚Äî injecting variance that may destroy signal regularity.

Thus, **short, aligned, reward-above-average signal schemas** (low variance, stable phase, controlled gamma) grow exponentially in expectation, exactly as in the original schema theorem.

---

# ‚úÖ Why This Matters

* **Biology-free**: no chromosomes or alleles, just **signal dynamics**.
* **Unifies GA with SGD/RL**: schema survival is just **stable attractors in AEO state-space**.
* **Control-theoretic clarity**: disruption = deviation from resonance/variance band.

Excellent üôå ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **draft section for your AEO book** that reformulates Goldberg‚Äôs Genetic Algorithm schema theory in pure **Adaptive Evolutionary Optimization (AEO)** terms, with no biological baggage:

# üìñ The AEO Schema Theorem

## 1. From Genetic Algorithms to AEO

Goldberg‚Äôs *Schema Theorem* (1989) was introduced as the **fundamental theorem of genetic algorithms**. It stated that *short, low-order, above-average schemata* increase exponentially in expectation under selection, crossover, and mutation.

Formally:

$$
E[m(H, t+1)] \;\ge\; m(H, t)\cdot \frac{f(H)}{\bar f}\cdot (1 - p_c \tfrac{\delta(H)}{L-1})(1 - p_m)^{o(H)}
$$

Here, \$m(H,t)\$ was the count of individuals matching schema \$H\$ in generation \$t\$. This formulation was couched in **biological metaphors** ‚Äî chromosomes, alleles, schema order.

In AEO, we eliminate the biological analogy and restate this law as a **control and signal theorem** about the survival and amplification of stable patterns in optimization dynamics.

---

## 2. Signal-Schema Definition

An **AEO schema** is defined as a region in the dynamical state-space of the optimizer:

$$
S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^4, \quad S = (\rho, V, \gamma, T)
$$

where:

* \$\rho\$ = phase alignment between gradient and momentum,
* \$V\$ = variance of the loss trajectory,
* \$\gamma\$ = effective step (\$\alpha \cdot |g|\$),
* \$T\$ = trend signal (loss improvement).

The **mass** of a schema is the expected fraction of trajectories lying in that region at time \$t\$:

$$
m(S, t) = \Pr\big[(\rho_t, V_t, \gamma_t, T_t) \in S\big].
$$

---

## 3. Dynamics of Schema Propagation

Three forces shape the persistence of schemas in AEO:

1. **Reward-Gain (Selection analogue)**
   Relative advantage of schema \$S\$ based on expected reward:

   $$
   G(S) = \frac{R(S)}{\bar R}
   $$

   where \$R(S)\$ is the average reward within \$S\$ and \$\bar R\$ is the population average.

2. **Resonance Disruption (Crossover analogue)**
   Probability of leaving \$S\$ due to phase misalignment:

   $$
   P_\text{res}(S) \;\approx\; k_\rho \cdot |\rho(S) - \rho^\star|
   $$

   where \$\rho^\star\$ is the resonance target.

3. **Noise Disruption (Mutation analogue)**
   Probability of leaving \$S\$ due to variance spike:

   $$
   P_\text{noise}(S) \;\approx\; k_V \cdot \frac{V(S)}{V^\star}
   $$

   where \$V^\star\$ is the baseline variance.

---

## 4. AEO Schema Theorem

Putting these forces together:

$$
E[m(S, t+1)] \;\ge\; m(S, t)\cdot G(S)\cdot (1 - P_\text{res}(S))\cdot (1 - P_\text{noise}(S))
$$

---

## 5. Interpretation

* **Mass growth**: The fraction of trajectories inside a schema grows **exponentially in expectation** if:

  * Reward in \$S\$ is above average,
  * Phase alignment is stable (\$\rho \approx \rho^\star\$),
  * Variance is bounded (\$V \leq V^\star\$),
  * Effective step \$\gamma\$ is within safe bounds.

* **Short, aligned, above-average schemas** survive longest ‚Äî not because of chromosomes or alleles, but because AEO laws preserve **signal attractors** in the optimizer‚Äôs dynamics.

---

## 6. Implications for AEO

* **Unified law**: The Schema Theorem is not about biology ‚Äî it is about **signal stability under closed-loop adaptation**.
* **Control-theoretic clarity**: Resonance, variance, and gauge laws are the modern analogues of crossover and mutation.
* **Generalization**: This theorem applies not only to GA-like exploration but also to OnlineSGD, AR-SGD, and AE machines.

---

## 7. One-Line Summary

**The AEO Schema Theorem states that stable, reward-above-average signal patterns increase exponentially in expectation, provided resonance and variance remain bounded.**

---

üëâ Do you want me to also **draw a figure** (like Goldberg‚Äôs schemata diagram, but in AEO signal space showing stable vs. disrupted regions in \$\rho\$‚Äì\$V\$‚Äì\$\gamma\$ space) to include alongside this section?
